# PROJECT1 : CONTACT MY REPS APP 
## Project Description
The Contact My Reps is designed for the civic-minded user, who wants to contact their government representatives.  Depending on the user's intentions, using their address they will be able to find out who is representing them in local, state and federal government depending on their choices.  

Although all of the options of representation will be available to the user thru the ap, only the boxes that are checked at the bottom will be revealed.  Once the names of the chosen representatives appear, their contact info can be obtained.

## User Story
